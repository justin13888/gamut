# ── Reconstructing the `--` cargo-fuzz needs ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `cargo fuzz run TARGET [CORPUS...] [-- <libFuzzer args>]` takes libFuzzer's arguments only after
# a `--`. mise SWALLOWS that separator: `mise run fuzz ifd_read_ledger -- -max_total_time=600`
# arrives here as two words, `ifd_read_ledger` and `-max_total_time=600`, and cargo-fuzz then
# rejects the second as one of its own options --
#
#     error: Found argument '-m' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context
#
# which is how the CI job failed on run 33467776925. `tooling/mutants/run.sh` documents the same
# swallow; this runner did not guard for it, so the bounded form the README advertises had never
# actually worked. The separator is therefore reconstructed rather than relied on.
#
# The discriminator is libFuzzer's own flag syntax, which is always `-name=value` -- a single dash
# and an `=`. cargo-fuzz's options are `--long`, `--long=value` or a single-letter short, none of
# which match. So `--release` and `-s none` still reach cargo-fuzz, and `-runs=100` still reaches
# libFuzzer, with or without a `--`. An explicit `--` (invoking this script directly, where nothing
# eats it) is honoured too: everything after it is libFuzzer's, unconditionally.
