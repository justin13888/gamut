//! fuzz · law — the pixel-conversion laws, searched rather than sampled.
//!
//! These are the *same* functions `gamut_core::invariants` exposes to the pinned-seed `proptest`
//! properties in the per-PR gate. Nothing is restated here: a law written twice is a law that can
//! disagree with itself, and both copies would keep passing against their own version of it.
//!
//! `gamut_core::convert` is the one place any `Pixel` layout converts to any other, so every
//! format crate inherits whatever is wrong with it. That is what makes an unbounded search worth
//! running over a 7 × 7 target matrix whose interesting cases — a zero alpha, a palette index past
//! the end, a threshold exactly at the midpoint — are sparse in a uniform sample.
//!
//! A crash found here is **minimised and promoted into a named deterministic test** in
//! `gamut-core`'s own suite. The corpus is a search aid, not the regression record.
