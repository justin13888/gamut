//! fuzz · law — the read ledger's laws, searched rather than sampled.
//!
//! These are the *same* functions `gamut_ifd::invariants` exposes to the pinned-seed `proptest`
//! properties in the per-PR gate. Nothing is restated here: a law written twice is a law that can
//! disagree with itself, and the whole point of the `invariants` module is that the property and
//! the fuzz target check one specification.
//!
//! What differs is the search. The property draws 512 cases from a fixed seed, which makes it
//! reproducible enough to gate a blocking mutation job. This tier is coverage-guided and
//! unbounded, so it goes looking for the case the property's 512 did not happen to contain — and
//! the pilot in #434 is the argument that such cases exist: the property there killed a mutant
//! `.cargo/mutants.toml` had recorded as *provably equivalent*, on an input (`reads = [{2747,
//! 103}], claims = [{2748, 0}]`) that no hand-written test had thought to try.
//!
//! A crash found here is **minimised and promoted into a named deterministic test** in
//! `gamut-ifd`'s own suite. The corpus is a search aid, not the regression record: a committed
//! seed is only reproducible while the generator is unchanged, and a named case is reproducible
//! forever.
