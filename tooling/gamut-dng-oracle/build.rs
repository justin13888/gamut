//! Builds the Adobe DNG SDK 1.7.1 headless from the ZIP in `references/dng/` and links it behind a
//! small `extern "C"` shim.
//!
//! The SDK ships only Visual Studio / Xcode projects, so we compile its `source/*.cpp` directly
//! with the `cc` crate. Three external dependencies the 1.7.1 source assumes are absent on a
//! headless Linux box, so each is replaced by a stub that satisfies the compile/link without
//! changing what the oracle observes (it validates pixel/structure conformance, not metadata):
//!
//! - **Adobe XMP Toolkit** — XMP is kept *enabled* (`qDNGUseXMP=1`, so `dng_metadata`/`dng_xmp`
//!   stay complete and every SDK unit compiles), but its toolkit bridge `dng_xmp_sdk.cpp` is
//!   excluded and replaced by the no-op `src/dng_xmp_sdk_stub.cpp`. The XMP files/doc-ops layers
//!   are off.
//! - **libjpeg** — off (`qDNGUseLibJPEG=0`); lossless JPEG is the SDK's own codec.
//! - **libjxl** — wired in unconditionally by 1.7.1; satisfied by the **real libjxl 0.12.0** that
//!   the `gamut-jxl-sys` dependency statically builds. The SDK is compiled against that exact
//!   build's installed headers (`DEP_JXL_INCLUDE`, published by gamut-jxl-sys's `links = "jxl"`
//!   metadata), and `links = "jxl"` guarantees a single libjxl copy per binary even when a test
//!   executable also links gamut-jxl's encoder — so the oracle genuinely decodes JPEG XL DNGs.
//!   Under `GAMUT_JXL_SYS_SKIP_NATIVE=1` (check-only environments without cmake) gamut-jxl-sys
//!   builds nothing; the SDK then compiles against its vendored libjxl headers with the link-only
//!   stubs in `src/jxl_stub.cpp` — that mode compiles but must never run JXL-touching tests
//!   (nothing links in check-only environments anyway).
//!
//! Only the system `zlib` (`-lz`) is genuinely required, since the SDK includes `zlib.h`
//! unconditionally for its Deflate and big-table paths.
//!
//! Everything lands under `OUT_DIR`, so `cargo clean` fully resets the build. CI needs the ZIP
//! (committed under `references/dng/`) and a C++ toolchain + zlib headers; nothing else.
