//! AV1 multi-symbol arithmetic (range) coder (AV1 §8.2), both directions.
//!
//! The AV1 spec defines only the *decoder* (§8.2 "Parsing process for symbol decoder").
//! [`SymbolDecoder`] is a direct transcription of it; [`SymbolEncoder`] is the matching encoder,
//! derived by inverting it, producing a byte stream the §8.2 decoder maps back to the symbols that
//! were encoded. The arithmetic mirrors the well-known `od_ec` range coder (the same one in
//! libaom / rav1e), which is purpose-built for this decoder.
//!
//! CDF convention (matches §8.2.6): a CDF for `N` symbols is a slice of `N` cumulative values in
//! `[0, 32768]`, strictly non-decreasing, with `cdf[N - 1] == 32768`. `cdf[i]` is the cumulative
//! probability (× 32768) of symbols `0..=i`. Two coding modes are provided:
//! [`SymbolEncoder::encode_symbol`] codes against a *static* CDF (`disable_cdf_update = 1`), while
//! [`SymbolEncoder::encode_symbol_adapt`] applies the §8.2.6 adaptation after each symbol
//! (`disable_cdf_update = 0`), nudging the CDF toward the just-coded symbol. The adaptation counter
//! the spec keeps as a trailing `cdf[N]` element is carried alongside as a separate `&mut u16`; a
//! decoder must apply the identical update after each symbol to stay in lockstep.
//!
//! The two are each other's hermetic oracle: this module's round-trip tests prove the encoder
//! correct without any external decoder, and prove the decoder recovers exactly what was coded —
//! including that both sides' adapting CDFs stay bit-identical.
