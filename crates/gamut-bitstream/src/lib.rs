//! Low-level bit readers/writers and entropy coders shared by the gamut codecs.
//!
//! The pieces here implement the parsing processes defined in the AV1 Bitstream & Decoding
//! Process Specification (`references/av1/av1-spec.pdf`), and their encoder-side mirrors:
//!
//! - [`BitWriter`] / [`BitReader`] — most-significant-bit-first fixed-width fields (`f(n)`) and
//!   byte alignment, used by the AV1 uncompressed sequence/frame headers (AV1 §4, §8.1). The
//!   reader also covers `su(n)`, `ns(n)`, `uvlc()`, `le(n)`, and `leb128()`.
//! - [`write_leb128`] / [`leb128_len`] — unsigned LEB128 used for OBU sizes (AV1 §4.10.5, Annex B).
//! - [`SymbolDecoder`] / [`SymbolEncoder`] — the AV1 multi-symbol arithmetic (range) coder of
//!   §8.2, the entropy back-end for coded tile data. The decoder is the normative direction; the
//!   encoder is derived by inverting it.
//!
//! It also carries codec-agnostic bit-packing primitives:
//!
//! - [`pack_msb_rows`] / [`unpack_msb_rows`] — MSB-first packing of fixed-width integer samples into
//!   byte-aligned rows, the sub-byte sample layout shared by the TIFF-family raw formats.
//!
//! The forward-looking ANS / Huffman coders named in the workspace plan (for AV2 / JPEG XL) are
//! not implemented yet; they will join this crate behind their own modules.
