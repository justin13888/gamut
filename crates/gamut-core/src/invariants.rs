//! Executable laws for the layout-conversion engine, shared by the property tests and the fuzz
//! tier.
//!
//! Each function takes plain data, checks one law, and returns a [`Violation`] naming what broke
//! it. No test framework is involved and nothing here panics, so the same body runs under a
//! pinned-seed `proptest` in the per-PR gate and under a corpus-guided driver in extended CI
//! (issues #264, #311).
//!
//! `convert` is the largest body of algorithmic content in the workspace with **no oracle
//! anywhere** — no reference implementation converts gamut's pixel matrix, and no specification
//! ships vectors for it — so `docs/testing.md` names `gamut-core` a crate where a property is the
//! primary signal rather than a supplement. The laws here are the module's own documented
//! contract: which conversions are refused, what shape the output has, and the two narrowings the
//! documentation calls exact inverses of their widenings.
//!
//! Note that these laws are stated over [`convert_from_raw`], not [`convert`]. The typed door is a
//! one-line delegation to the raw one, so a law asserting the two agree would be checking the
//! compiler rather than the engine.
//!
//! This module is the test oracle, not the system under test, so `.cargo/mutants.toml` excludes
//! `crates/*/src/invariants.rs` from mutation.
