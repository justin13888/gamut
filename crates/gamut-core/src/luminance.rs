//! Two independent groups live here:
//!
//! - **Reference levels** in candela per square metre (cd/m², "nits"). Provenance is recorded in
//!   `references/color/README.md` (Report ITU-R BT.2408 — HDR Reference White; SMPTE ST 2084 /
//!   ITU-R BT.2100 — PQ peak).
//! - **Luma weights** — the `KR`/`KG`/`KB` coefficients that collapse an RGB triple to a single
//!   luma sample, as fixed-point integers (see [`LUMA_FIX`]). They are what
//!   [`crate::convert`] uses for an RGB → grayscale reduction, and what `gamut_color`'s BT.601
//!   YCbCr luma row is built from.
