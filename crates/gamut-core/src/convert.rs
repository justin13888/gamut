//! Format-agnostic conversion between interleaved pixel layouts, with every lossy decision made
//! explicit by the caller.
//!
//! Decoders present an image in whatever layout the file natively carries. A caller usually wants
//! one specific layout instead, and bridging the two splits cleanly in half:
//!
//! - **Lossless widening** — replicating grey into RGB, adding an opaque alpha channel, widening
//!   8-bit samples to 16 — throws nothing away and needs no permission.
//! - **Lossy narrowing** — dropping an alpha channel, narrowing 16-bit samples to 8, reducing RGB
//!   to a single luma sample — destroys information, and *which* information it destroys is a
//!   policy question with no universally right answer.
//!
//! This module defines both halves once, for every [`Pixel`] layout, so format crates never have to
//! answer the policy questions themselves. A conversion is refused with [`Error::Unsupported`]
//! unless the [`ConvertPolicy`] explicitly permits the loss it would incur — [`ConvertPolicy`]'s
//! default is [`ConvertPolicy::lossless`], which permits none of it.
//!
//! # Two entry points, one engine
//!
//! [`convert`] is the typed door: `ImageRef<'_, P>` in, [`ImageBuf<Q>`] out. Callers use this.
//!
//! [`convert_from_raw`] is the decoder door. A decoder knows its target layout statically (it is
//! implementing [`DecodeImage<Q>`](crate::DecodeImage)) but discovers the file's native layout at
//! runtime, so its source is a [`RawImage`] carrying a [`PixelFormat`] tag rather than a brand.
//! [`convert_from_raw_into`] writes into caller-provided storage, backing
//! [`DecodeImage::decode_image_into`](crate::DecodeImage::decode_image_into).
//!
//! # What is out of scope
//!
//! [`Indexed8`](crate::Indexed8) and [`Cmyk8`](crate::Cmyk8) convert only to themselves. Palette
//! indices are meaningless without the palette table, which the single-buffer model cannot carry
//! (see `gamut-core`'s deferred shared-palette primitive), and CMYK↔RGB is a colour-management
//! transform requiring an ICC rendering intent — not a layout rearrangement. Both refuse with a
//! message naming the missing machinery rather than silently applying a naive approximation.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use gamut_core::{
//!     convert::{convert, AlphaPolicy, ConvertPolicy},
//!     Dimensions, ImageRef, Rgb8, Rgba8,
//! };
//!
//! let dims = Dimensions::new(2, 1).unwrap();
//! // Two half-transparent red pixels.
//! let rgba = [255u8, 0, 0, 128, 255, 0, 0, 128];
//! let image = ImageRef::<Rgba8>::new(&rgba, dims).unwrap();
//!
//! // Refused by default: dropping alpha loses information.
//! assert!(convert::<Rgba8, Rgb8>(image, ConvertPolicy::lossless()).is_err());
//!
//! // Permitted once the caller says how alpha should be handled.
//! let policy = ConvertPolicy::lossless().with_alpha(AlphaPolicy::Drop);
//! let rgb = convert::<Rgba8, Rgb8>(image, policy).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(rgb.as_samples(), &[255, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0]);
//! ```
