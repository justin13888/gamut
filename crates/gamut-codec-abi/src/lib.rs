//! The shared codestream-backend seam: one `repr(C)` vtable shape (plus its object-safe Rust
//! "twin" traits) that lets a foreign (C/FFI) or alternate codestream backend plug into any gamut
//! format crate, together with the fallback contract that governs how a host selects among them.
//!
//! A gamut format crate (avif, heic, the `av2`/`vvc` stubs once implemented, …) owns the
//! *container* and everything around the coded picture, but the codestream encode/decode itself is
//! often better served by a platform or reference codec. This crate defines the **call shape** and
//! the **fallback contract** for that seam so every format crate wires backends the same way:
//!
//! - Backends are held in a host-owned registry, tried in **push order**; a software fallback (when
//!   a crate ships one) is the implicit tail, tried last.
//! - [`Decoder::supports`] / [`Encoder::supports`] returning `false` (or the C
//!   [`Status::UNSUPPORTED`]) is the **only** signal that lets the host fall through to the next
//!   backend. Any other outcome is terminal.
//! - A backend that *accepts* a job ([`supports`](Decoder::supports) → `true`) and then fails
//!   returns a non-OK [`Status`], which propagates to the caller — the host does **not** retry a
//!   later backend, because a partially-produced result must not be silently masked.
//!
//! # Two mirrored surfaces
//!
//! Every capability exists twice, 1:1:
//!
//! - **Rust twins** — the object-safe [`Decoder`] / [`Encoder`] traits. A pure-Rust backend
//!   implements these directly; a format crate consumes `&mut dyn Decoder` / `&mut dyn Encoder`.
//! - **`repr(C)` vtables** — [`DecoderVTable`] / [`EncoderVTable`]: a function-pointer table plus an
//!   opaque `ctx` pointer, the shape a C or `-sys` backend exposes. Leading each vtable is an
//!   [`abi_version`](DecoderVTable::abi_version) equal to [`ABI_VERSION`]; leading each descriptor
//!   is a [`struct_size`](StreamConfig::struct_size) for forward-compatible field growth.
//!
//! The [`bridge`] module converts between the two: [`bridge::ForeignDecoder`] /
//! [`bridge::ForeignEncoder`] adapt a C vtable *into* a Rust twin (C → Rust), and
//! [`bridge::lower_decoder`] / [`bridge::lower_encoder`] expose a boxed Rust twin *as* a C vtable
//! (Rust → C). Those adapters are the crate's only `unsafe`.
//!
//! # Scope and design notes
//!
//! - **`#![no_std]`, dependency-free.** The seam is pure interface: primitive fields, raw pointers,
//!   and function pointers only. `alloc` is pulled in solely for the `Box`-based [`bridge`] lowering.
//! - **No `Send` supertrait.** [`Decoder`] / [`Encoder`] are deliberately *not* `Send`; a host binds
//!   `Send` at the point it inserts a backend into a registry, so single-threaded backends stay
//!   usable. The C → Rust adapters offer an `unsafe` constructor by which the caller *asserts*
//!   thread-safety, at which point the adapter is `Send`.
//! - **C-friendly plain data.** Descriptors carry `u32` ids/dimensions and raw pointer + length
//!   pairs; they map onto a C struct with no translation layer, matching the
//!   `gamut_heic::HevcDecoder` precedent (single object-safe method, borrowed bytes in, owned plain
//!   data out).
