//! The pluggable **codestream backend** seam (issue #276): the typed traits, plain-data descriptors
//! and push-order registry by which an alternate JPEG XL codestream implementation is tried ahead of
//! the crate's built-in ones.
//!
//! # Where the seam cuts
//!
//! The boundary is the **bare JPEG XL codestream** — the byte string that starts with the two-byte
//! signature `FF 0A`. A backend receives a raster plus a plain-data description of the job and
//! returns codestream bytes ([`JxlCodestreamEncoder`]); or receives codestream bytes and returns a
//! raster ([`JxlCodestreamDecoder`]). Everything *outside* the codestream — ISO BMFF container
//! framing, `Exif`/`xml ` metadata boxes, and `jbrd` JPEG-reconstruction metadata — stays with the
//! host and is **never** delegated (see [the container veto](#container-feature-veto)).
//!
//! # The built-ins are the tail
//!
//! gamut-jxl's own wrappers are ordinary backends that sit implicitly **last**:
//!
//! - with the `encode` feature (and an encoder-capable target), libjxl is the last encode backend;
//! - with the `decode` feature, jxl-rs is the last decode backend.
//!
//! [`JxlEncoder::push_backend`](crate::JxlEncoder::push_backend) /
//! [`JxlDecoder::push_backend`](crate::JxlDecoder::push_backend) insert a backend *ahead* of that
//! tail. A pushed encode backend is therefore also what **supplies encode on `wasm32`**, where the
//! libjxl tail cannot be built at all. With no pushed backend and no built-in tail, the direction
//! reports [`gamut_core::Error::Unsupported`].
//!
//! # Fallback contract
//!
//! Backends are tried in **push order**, the built-in tail last. Exactly two outcomes fall through
//! to the next backend:
//!
//! 1. [`supports`](JxlCodestreamEncoder::supports) returning `false` — the backend declines before
//!    doing any work;
//! 2. `Err(`[`Error::Unsupported`](gamut_core::Error::Unsupported)`)` from
//!    [`encode`](JxlCodestreamEncoder::encode) / [`decode`](JxlCodestreamDecoder::decode) — a *late*
//!    decline, the typed mirror of the C [`Status::UNSUPPORTED`](gamut_codec_abi::Status::UNSUPPORTED)
//!    code the [`crate::abi`] adapters translate.
//!
//! **Any other error is terminal** and propagates to the caller unchanged: a backend that accepted a
//! job and then failed may have produced a partial result, which must never be silently masked by
//! retrying a later backend.
//!
//! # Container-feature veto
//!
//! Container-dependent encoder features are pinned to the built-in path, and the veto is applied
//! **host-side** — a backend is not even asked. When
//! [`Container::IsoBmff`](crate::Container) output, [`with_exif`](crate::JxlEncoder::with_exif) /
//! [`with_xmp`](crate::JxlEncoder::with_xmp) embedding, or
//! [`recompress_jpeg`](crate::JxlEncoder::recompress_jpeg) is requested, the registry is skipped
//! entirely. The seam is the bare codestream, so a backend has no way to express container framing;
//! consulting it would either lose the request or invite a silently mis-framed stream.
