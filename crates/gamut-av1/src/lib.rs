//! AV1 image encoder. AVIF relies on AV1 intra-frame coding, so this crate is available
//! standalone as well as through [`gamut-avif`](https://crates.io/crates/gamut-avif).
//!
//! M0 implemented the minimal path: a **lossless** all-intra keyframe — `seq_profile = 1`
//! (8-bit 4:4:4), identity matrix coefficients, full range, single tile, 64×64 superblocks,
//! `DC_PRED`, and the forced `TX_4X4` Walsh–Hadamard transform. The crate now also encodes
//! **lossy** all-intra keyframes: a wide intra mode set (the eight directional modes with
//! `angle_delta`, `SMOOTH`/`SMOOTH_V`/`SMOOTH_H`/`PAETH`, recursive filter-intra, chroma-from-luma,
//! and palette), DCT/ADST/identity transforms with variable `tx_depth` and `TX_SET_INTRA_2` type
//! selection, recursive partitioning, per-superblock delta-Q/delta-LF, segmentation, uniform
//! multi-tile, and the in-loop filters (deblocking, CDEF, loop restoration, superres). Symbols are
//! coded against **adapting CDFs** (`disable_cdf_update = 0`): each tile starts from the §9.4
//! defaults and nudges every context toward what it codes, which costs no fidelity and shrinks a
//! still by roughly 20–35%. It produces the AV1 temporal unit that `gamut-avif` wraps in an AVIF
//! still image.
//!
//! The colour signalling is selectable: [`encode_still_intra_with`] takes an [`Av1Colour`] (CICP
//! primaries/transfer/matrix plus the signal range) and mirrors it into `color_config()` and, via
//! [`EncodedStill::config`], the container's `av1C`/`colr` boxes. The caller supplies either GBR
//! planes (identity) or `Y/Cb/Cr` planes (see `gamut_color::Planar8::from_rgb8_matrix`).
//!
//! **Chroma sampling** comes from the buffer itself: 4:4:4, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 are all coded, as is a
//! monochrome luma plane. The identity matrix requires 4:4:4 (§6.4.2) and a subsampled identity
//! encode is refused; so is a *lossless* subsampled encode, whose §5.11.45 `is_cfl_allowed` rule
//! this encoder does not implement. Under 4:2:2 the partition search drops `PARTITION_VERT`, since
//! §6.10.4 forbids a block whose chroma residual would be `BLOCK_INVALID`.
//!
//! **Bit depth** is the buffer's too: [`encode_still_intra16_with`] takes a
//! [`gamut_color::Planar16`] and codes at the depth it carries. Every depth-derived quantity
//! follows it: the quantizer tables, the dequant and inverse-transform clamps, the
//! `1 << (BitDepth - 1)` intra seeds, the palette's `L(BitDepth)` colours, the deblock centring and
//! thresholds, CDEF's `coeffShift`, and the Wiener rounding pair.
//!
//! The two axes compose, and `seq_profile` follows §6.4.1 across the whole matrix: Main (0) for
//! 4:2:0 and for 8/10-bit monochrome, High (1) for 8/10-bit 4:4:4, and Professional (2) for 4:2:2
//! and for anything 12-bit — the one case that *codes* `subsampling_x`/`subsampling_y` rather than
//! leaving the decoder to infer them from the profile (§5.5.2).
//!
//! The remaining surface (quantizer matrices, and the AVIF-level metadata/container features) is
//! tracked in `gamut-avif/STATUS.md`.
//!
//! Modules mirror the spec: [`headers`] = OBU framing + sequence/frame headers (AV1 §5.3/§5.5/§5.9),
//! `tile` = partition/prediction/coefficient coding (§5.11), [`transform`] = forward/inverse 2-D
//! transforms (§7.13), `cdf` = default CDF + scan + context tables and the adapting per-tile CDF
//! context (§9.2/§9.4/§8.2.6/§8.3.2),
//! [`quant`] = quantizer tables + dequant (§7.12), `filter` = in-loop filters (§7.14-§7.17).
