# gamut-av1

`gamut-av1` is a pure-Rust AV1 still-image codec. AVIF relies on AV1 intra-frame coding, so this
crate is usable standalone as well as through [`gamut-avif`](../gamut-avif). The encoder is
complete for its documented scope; the **decoder** is being built out slice by slice under
[issue #259](https://github.com/visualcommons/gamut/issues/259).

If you want a complete `.avif` file, use [`gamut-avif`](../gamut-avif). Reach for this crate when you
need the **raw AV1 still bitstream** itself — to embed in your own container or build another
AV1-based format. It operates on `Planar8` planes and emits an AV1 temporal unit, not a container.

## Goals

Part of the [gamut](../../README.md) workspace, this crate exists to provide AV1 **still-image
encoding** that is:

- **Memory-safe on hostile input.** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` across the whole encode path, deleting
  the memory-corruption bug class that has repeatedly bitten the C AV1 codecs.
- **Clean-slate from the spec.** Implemented directly from the AV1 Bitstream & Decoding Process
  Specification ([`../../references/av1/`](../../references/av1)) rather than wrapping libaom, so it
  is auditable and forkable. Modules mirror the spec: `headers` = OBU framing + sequence/frame
  headers (§5.3/§5.5/§5.9), `tile` = partition/prediction/coefficient coding (§5.11), `cdf` =
  default CDF + scan + context tables (§9.2/§9.4/§8.3.2).
- **Verified against the AV1 reference codec.** Output is checked bit-exact against real decoders —
  `libaom` (the AOMedia reference codec, the definitive oracle) and `dav1d` — linked from vendored
  `third_party/` submodules, never from system-installed binaries. See
  [`references/av1`](../../references/av1/README.md).
- **Buildable anywhere `cargo` is.** No C, no nasm — cross-compiles cleanly (wasm32, aarch64, musl).

It builds on [`gamut-color`](../gamut-color) (pixel formats / CICP), [`gamut-dsp`](../gamut-dsp)
(the Walsh–Hadamard transform), and [`gamut-bitstream`](../gamut-bitstream) (bit writer + AV1 symbol
coder).

## Usage

```rust
use gamut_av1::encode_still_lossless_identity;
use gamut_color::Planar8;

// 8-bit interleaved RGB -> identity 4:4:4 planes -> lossless AV1 keyframe.
let (width, height) = (64u32, 64u32);
let rgb = vec![0u8; (width * height * 3) as usize];
let planes = Planar8::from_rgb8_identity(&rgb, width, height).expect("valid input");

let still = encode_still_lossless_identity(&planes).expect("encode");
// `still.obus` is the AV1 temporal unit; `still.config` carries the sequence-header
// values that `gamut-avif` mirrors into the `av1C`/`colr` boxes.
std::fs::write("out.obu", &still.obus).unwrap();
```

## Status

Today (milestone **M0**) the encoder implements a single, narrow path: a **lossless** all-intra
keyframe — `seq_profile = 1`, 8-bit 4:4:4, identity matrix coefficients, full range, single tile,
64×64 superblocks, `DC_PRED`, and the forced `TX_4X4` Walsh–Hadamard transform. Symbols are coded
against adapting CDFs (`disable_cdf_update = 0`, AV1 §8.2.6): each tile starts from the §9.4
defaults and nudges every context toward what it codes. It produces the AV1 temporal unit that
`gamut-avif` wraps in an AVIF still image.

The colour signalling is selectable on top of that: `encode_still_intra_with` takes an
`Av1Colour` (the CICP primaries/transfer/matrix triple plus the signal range) and mirrors it into
the sequence header's `color_config()` and the `av1C`/`colr` values `gamut-avif` stamps. A
luma–chroma matrix changes what the samples mean, not their geometry.

**Monochrome** (`mono_chrome = 1`, `seq_profile = 0`) is the one geometry that is selectable: pass
a `ChromaSubsampling::Cs400` `Planar8` — one luma plane, no chroma — and the encoder codes a single
plane and drops every chroma syntax element the spec gates on `NumPlanes > 1`. Use
`Av1Colour::monochrome()` rather than the default: §5.5.2 infers `subsampling_x = subsampling_y = 1`
for a monochrome stream and §6.4.2 permits `MC_IDENTITY` only at 0/0, so the default identity matrix
is rejected. The subsampled geometries (4:2:0 / 4:2:2) are still deferred.

The wider AV1 surface — lossy DCT/ADST, more intra modes, in-loop filters, inter coding for image
sequences — is tracked row by row in [`gamut-avif/STATUS.md`](../gamut-avif/STATUS.md), whose
section N is the decoder's ledger.

## Decoding

Behind the default-on `decode` feature. Today it reads the **framing and header layer** of an AV1
still — the OBU walk (§5.3), the full sequence header (§5.5) in both its reduced and general
forms, the full uncompressed frame header (§5.9), and tile-group framing (§5.11.1):

```rust
use gamut_av1::Av1Decoder;

# fn main() -> Result<(), gamut_core::Error> {
# let temporal_unit: &[u8] = &[];
# if !temporal_unit.is_empty() {
let info = Av1Decoder::new().inspect(temporal_unit)?;
println!(
    "{}x{} at {}-bit",
    info.frame.upscaled_width, info.frame.frame_height, info.sequence.color.bit_depth,
);
# }
# Ok(())
# }
```

Sample decoding — the tile body, reconstruction and the in-loop filters — is **not implemented
yet**, and no entry point pretends otherwise. Streams are accepted only at `seq_profile = 1`
(8-bit 4:4:4) with intra key frames; every other tool is refused with a typed
`Error::Unsupported` naming it, never approximated. `default-features = false` drops the decoder
entirely and leaves the encoder-only crate unchanged.

It is checked against **libaom**, the AV1 reference codec, in the direction that matters for a
decoder: libaom *encodes* the stills and its own decoder says what they mean, so the suite
exercises tools this crate's encoder never emits.

## Roadmap

- M1: lossy intra (DCT/ADST + quantization), adaptive CDFs ✅, more intra prediction modes.
- #259: the pure-Rust decoder — headers ✅, then tile parsing, reconstruction, the in-loop
  filters, and the 10/12-bit + 4:2:0/4:2:2 pixel-format matrix.
- Later: in-loop filters, multi-tile, and inter coding for animated AVIF.
