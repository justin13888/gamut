//! The pluggable **whole-interchange-stream** codestream seam: [`JpegStreamDecoder`],
//! [`JpegStreamEncoder`], and their [`gamut_codec_abi`] adapters.
//!
//! # Why the seam is the whole SOI..EOI stream
//!
//! Every other gamut format crate splits cleanly into *container* (crate-owned) and *codestream*
//! (delegable): AVIF hands an OBU sequence to an AV1 decoder, HEIC hands a length-prefixed NAL
//! payload to an HEVC decoder. **JPEG-1 has no such split to invert.** Its marker segments and its
//! entropy-coded data interleave in one byte stream (T.81 §B.1.1.5 — entropy-coded segments are
//! delimited by markers, with `0xFF00` byte stuffing inside them), and the Huffman/bit layer
//! ([`crate::huffman`], [`crate::bitwriter`]) is intrinsic to the frame structure it codes: a scan
//! cannot be lifted out of its SOF/DHT/DQT context and still mean anything.
//!
//! So the seam is defined at the **whole SOI..EOI interchange stream** — the unit every real JPEG
//! engine actually consumes: nvJPEG (`nvjpegDecode` takes the JPEG file bytes), V4L2 stateful and
//! stateless JPEG (`V4L2_PIX_FMT_JPEG`/`JPEG_RAW` take the interchange stream), and libjpeg-turbo
//! (`jpeg_mem_src`). A finer per-scan entropy seam would publicize the crate's internal DCT
//! coefficient, quantizer, and Huffman state as public API — a sub-stream boundary **no** real
//! accelerator consumes, for zero consumers.
//!
//! # The explicit consequence: metadata + validation ownership
//!
//! Because the seam is the whole stream, the workspace convention that "the crate owns the
//! container" degenerates, for JPEG, to the crate owning **metadata and validation**:
//!
//! - **Decode** — the crate still parses the marker layer *first*, into a [`JpegStreamInfo`]
//!   (dimensions, process, per-component sampling, precision), and only then hands the **full**
//!   stream to the first backend whose [`JpegStreamDecoder::supports`] returns `true`. APPn metadata
//!   (EXIF / XMP / multi-segment ICC) is **never** delegated: [`crate::metadata`] is a crate-side
//!   marker walk that no backend can observe, intercept, or alter.
//! - **Encode** — a backend produces the **full** JFIF stream from the raster and the
//!   [`JpegEncodeRequest`]; the crate then validates it (SOI..EOI framing, parsable marker layer)
//!   and **owns the APPn metadata segments in it**: any EXIF / XMP / `ICC_PROFILE` segment the
//!   backend emitted is stripped and the encoder's configured metadata is written in its place, at
//!   the crate's canonical position (after the leading APP0 run). Metadata is therefore *patched*,
//!   never double-written, and the [`crate::JpegEncoder`] caps (`with_exif` / `with_xmp` /
//!   `with_icc_profile`) are validated before any backend is consulted.
//!
//! This is an accepted degradation, not an oversight: any narrower ownership boundary for JPEG
//! would be fictional.
//!
//! # Fallback contract
//!
//! Backends are tried in **push order** ([`crate::JpegDecoder::push_backend`] /
//! [`crate::JpegEncoder::push_backend`]); the crate's own built-in codec is the implicit tail and
//! runs last. `supports() == false` is the only signal that falls through to the next backend. A
//! backend that accepts a job and *then* fails **propagates** its error — the built-in tail is not
//! retried, because a partially-produced result must never be silently masked. The one exception is
//! the codec-abi adapters' *late* [`Status::UNSUPPORTED`](gamut_codec_abi::Status::UNSUPPORTED),
//! which is a decline expressed after acceptance; it is carried as the
//! [`backend_declined`] sentinel error and re-enters the fall-through path.
