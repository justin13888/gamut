//! The baseline sequential DCT Huffman encoder: [`JpegEncoder`] and its pipeline.
//!
//! For each 8×8 block the pipeline is T.81 Annex A end to end — colour-convert (T.871 §7) →
//! chroma-subsample → level shift (§A.3.1) → forward DCT (§A.3.3, via `gamut_dsp`) → quantize
//! (§A.3.4) → zig-zag (§A.3.6) → differential DC + run-length AC Huffman coding (Annex F §F.1.2) —
//! interleaved into minimum coded units (§A.2.3) and wrapped in a JFIF interchange stream (§B.2).
//!
//! The entropy coder runs through [`BaselineCoder`], which either **emits** codes or merely
//! **gathers** symbol frequencies. The fixed-table path runs one emit pass; the optimized-table path
//! ([`JpegEncoder::with_optimized_tables`]) runs a gather pass first, builds the Annex K.2 tables
//! from what it counted, and then emits — both passes driven by the same [`encode_scan`] walk, so a
//! symbol can never be written without having been counted.
