# gamut-jpeg

`gamut-jpeg` is a pure-Rust, spec-compliant **JPEG-1** (ISO/IEC 10918-1 | ITU-T T.81) still-image
codec.

## Goals

Part of the [gamut](../../README.md) workspace, this crate reads and writes JPEG-1 images that are:

- **Spec-compliant.** Implemented directly against ITU-T T.81 (the core codec) and T.871 (JFIF),
  with clause citations in the source. Correctness is proven differentially against libjpeg-turbo
  (see Validation).
- **Encoder + decoder.** Unlike the workspace's encoder-only PNG crate, JPEG is a two-way format:
  a baseline sequential and **progressive (SOF2)** DCT Huffman **encoder** and a **sequential +
  progressive decoder** ship together (see [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)).
- **Memory-safe.** 100% safe Rust (`#![deny(unsafe_code)]`).

## Usage

Encode an RGB image to a JFIF stream:

```rust
use gamut_core::{Dimensions, EncodeImage, ImageRef, Rgb8};
use gamut_jpeg::{ChromaSubsampling, JpegEncoder};

let (w, h) = (16, 16);
let rgb = vec![0u8; (w * h * 3) as usize];
let image = ImageRef::<Rgb8>::new(&rgb, Dimensions::new(w, h)?)?;
let mut jpeg = Vec::new();
JpegEncoder::new()
    .with_quality(85)
    .with_subsampling(ChromaSubsampling::Ycbcr420)
    .encode_image(image, &mut jpeg)?;
# Ok::<(), gamut_core::Error>(())
```

Decode a JPEG back to pixels (grayscale is replicated across channels; YCbCr/RGB present as RGB;
four-component CMYK/YCCK decode via `Cmyk8`):

```rust
use gamut_core::{DecodeImage, ImageBuf, Rgb8};
use gamut_jpeg::JpegDecoder;

# fn demo(jpeg: &[u8]) -> Result<(), gamut_core::Error> {
let image: ImageBuf<Rgb8> = JpegDecoder::new().decode_image(jpeg)?;
let info = gamut_jpeg::info(jpeg)?; // dimensions / components / process, without decoding
# let _ = (image, info);
# Ok(())
# }
```

For untrusted input, opt in to both geometry and native-raster budgets. The byte cap counts the
JPEG frame's own components, independently of the requested presentation type:

```rust
# use gamut_core::{DecodeImage, ImageBuf, Rgb8};
# use gamut_jpeg::JpegDecoder;
# fn demo(jpeg: &[u8]) -> Result<(), gamut_core::Error> {
let decoder = JpegDecoder::new()
    .with_max_dimensions(16_384, 16_384)
    .with_max_image_bytes(64 * 1024 * 1024);
let image: ImageBuf<Rgb8> = decoder.decode_image(jpeg)?;
# let _ = image;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Read and write embedded APP-segment metadata — APP1 EXIF, APP1 XMP, and multi-segment APP2 ICC
(the payloads are raw bytes in exactly the form `gamut-metadata`'s `MetadataBlock` borrows):

```rust
use gamut_core::{Dimensions, EncodeImage, Gray8, ImageRef};
use gamut_jpeg::JpegEncoder;

# fn demo(tiff: &[u8], icc: &[u8]) -> Result<(), gamut_core::Error> {
let pixels = vec![0u8; 64];
let image = ImageRef::<Gray8>::new(&pixels, Dimensions::new(8, 8)?)?;
let jpeg = JpegEncoder::new()
    .with_exif(tiff)          // "Exif\0\0" + TIFF APP1 (Exif 3.0 §4.7.2)
    .with_icc_profile(icc)    // APP2 ICC_PROFILE chunks (ICC.1 Annex B.4)
    .encode_to_vec(image)?;

let meta = gamut_jpeg::metadata(&jpeg)?; // header-only walk, no pixel decode
assert_eq!(meta.exif.as_deref(), Some(tiff));
assert_eq!(meta.icc.as_deref(), Some(icc));
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Status

Built incrementally; each phase is conformance-checked against libjpeg-turbo (see
[STATUS.md](STATUS.md)). Shipping now: an **8-bit DCT Huffman encoder** for the baseline sequential
(SOF0) and **progressive (SOF2)** processes, and a **decoder for the sequential and progressive
processes**. The encoder writes grayscale and JFIF YCbCr with 4:4:4 / 4:2:2 / 4:2:0 chroma
subsampling, standard (Annex K) tables, and optional restart intervals;
`JpegEncoder::with_optimized_tables(true)` swaps the fixed tables for ones built from the image's own
symbol statistics (Annex K.2) — a few percent smaller, same decoded pixels;
`JpegEncoder::with_progressive(true)` selects the progressive process — libjpeg's frozen
`jpeg_simple_progression` scan script with optimized per-scan Huffman tables (Annex K.2), producing
the same coefficients (and thus the same decoded image) as the baseline encoding. The decoder reads
any spec-valid sequential or progressive stream — grayscale, YCbCr, RGB, and CMYK/YCCK (via the JFIF
APP0 / Adobe APP14 hints), interleaved or non-interleaved scans, spectral selection and successive
approximation, restart intervals, and (for sequential frames) DNL-defined heights — and never panics
on malformed input. Progressive frames with a deferred (`Y = 0` / DNL) height are rejected as
unsupported, and a partial progressive stream renders what it has (matching libjpeg).
`JpegDecoder::with_max_dimensions` and `with_max_image_bytes` provide opt-in hostile-input guards;
known SOF geometry is rejected before frame-sized allocation, and a sequential DNL-deferred height
is bounded while its first scan grows.

Embedded metadata ships both ways (P7): `metadata()` reads APP1 EXIF, APP1 XMP, and multi-segment
APP2 `ICC_PROFILE` payloads without decoding pixels, and the encoder embeds them via
`with_exif`/`with_xmp`/`with_icc_profile` — validated against libjpeg-turbo's own
`jpeg_read_icc_profile`/`jpeg_write_icc_profile` in both directions. `decode_image_into` reuses
the destination's allocation when dimensions match.

Both directions are **pluggable** (P8): `JpegDecoder::push_backend` / `JpegEncoder::push_backend`
register `JpegStreamDecoder` / `JpegStreamEncoder` backends — or a `gamut-codec-abi` backend through
the `AbiStreamDecoder` / `AbiStreamEncoder` adapters — tried in push order with the built-in codec as
the implicit tail. The seam is the **whole SOI..EOI interchange stream**, the unit real JPEG engines
(nvJPEG, V4L2 JPEG, libjpeg-turbo) consume, because JPEG's marker layer and entropy-coded data
interleave and expose no useful sub-stream boundary. The stated consequence: for JPEG, "the crate
owns the container" means the crate owns **metadata and validation** — APPn EXIF/XMP/ICC stays
crate-owned in both directions, and the crate patches its metadata into a backend-produced stream.

Out of scope (documented in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)): a finer per-scan codestream seam, 12-bit
precision, arithmetic coding
(SOF9/10), lossless (SOF3), hierarchical (SOF5–7), SPIFF/T.84 extensions, T.872 printing
conventions, ExtendedXMP continuation segments, and APP13 IPTC-IIM.

## Validation

A live differential gate (`tests/oracle.rs`) cross-checks against a vendored, dev-only
**libjpeg-turbo 3.2.0** static build (`tooling/libjpeg-oracle`) in both directions:

- **Encode** — gamut encodes, libjpeg-turbo decodes; the recovered pixels match the source within
  the format's lossy tolerance (measured: gray/4:4:4 within a few codes, subsampled above a PSNR
  floor). This proves gamut emits spec-valid streams the canonical reference decoder reads back.
- **Decode** — libjpeg-turbo encodes (including non-standard optimized Huffman tables and restart
  markers), gamut decodes and matches libjpeg-turbo's own decode of the same stream, isolating
  entropy/dequant/IDCT correctness from lossy encode error.

The byte stream is additionally cross-checked against the vendored T.873 reference software for
spec-exact behaviour. Running the gate builds the C oracle, so the tests need the
`third_party/libjpeg-turbo` submodule checked out and a C toolchain on `PATH`.
