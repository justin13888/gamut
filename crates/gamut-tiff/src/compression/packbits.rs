//! PackBits compression (TIFF 6.0 §9, `Compression = 32773`).
//!
//! PackBits is a simple byte-oriented run-length scheme. A control byte `n` (read as a signed
//! `i8`) means: `0..=127` → copy the next `n + 1` bytes literally; `-127..=-1` → copy the next
//! single byte `1 - n` times; `-128` → no-op. Each image row is packed independently (runs never
//! cross a row boundary), so the encoder works one row at a time.
