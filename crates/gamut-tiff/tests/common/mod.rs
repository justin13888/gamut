//! The pixel patterns the two libtiff cross-check suites share.
//!
//! `oracle.rs` and `bigtiff.rs` carried byte-identical copies of these. That is not incidental:
//! `bigtiff.rs` exists to prove the 64-bit container widens *only* the container, so its cases
//! deliberately mirror the classic ones. Two copies of the mirror is one copy too many — if they
//! ever drift the comparison stops meaning what its module doc says it means.
//!
//! **Only these two functions are shared, and that is deliberate.** Eight files in this crate
//! define an `rgb_pattern`, in six distinct variants, and the other four are *not* duplicates:
//! `lzw.rs` and `packbits.rs` build run-length-friendly bands sized to their coders,
//! `predictor.rs` builds smooth gradients so horizontal differencing has something to remove, and
//! `tiles.rs` and `image_roundtrip.rs` pick constants that vary across tile boundaries. Each is
//! payload chosen for the feature under test, and collapsing them into one "shared" pattern would
//! quietly weaken every one of those suites.
