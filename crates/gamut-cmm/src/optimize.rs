//! Stage-collapsing pipeline optimization: the opt-in throughput path (#372).
//!
//! v1 evaluates a transform stage by stage, which is the clearest and most testable model but
//! pays a per-pixel cost for every stage a profile link happens to produce — a two-shaper pair
//! runs six `powf` calls and two 3×3 products per pixel where one grid lookup would do. lcms2
//! collapses such a chain into a single precalculated table by default (`cmsopt.c`); this
//! module is that idea, transcribed into the crate's `Pipeline`/`Stage` model and put **behind
//! an opt-in knob** ([`PipelineOptimization`], default [`None`](PipelineOptimization::None)) so
//! v1's exact stage-by-stage numerics stay the default.
//!
//! # The passes
//!
//! | pass | level | what it does |
//! |------|-------|--------------|
//! | identity elision | [`Collapse`](PipelineOptimization::Collapse) | drops [`Stage::Identity`] and any exactly-identity affine stage |
//! | matrix folding | [`Collapse`](PipelineOptimization::Collapse) | replaces an adjacent affine pair with their composed affine |
//! | curve joining | [`Precalculate`](PipelineOptimization::Precalculate) | tabulates an adjacent [`Stage::Curves`] pair as one curve set |
//! | CLUT resampling | [`Precalculate`](PipelineOptimization::Precalculate) | replaces the whole chain with one resampled [`Stage::Clut`] |
//!
//! Elision and folding both shrink the stage list by one, so the two run together to a
//! fixpoint (termination is structural: every rewriting pass strictly reduces the stage
//! count).
//!
//! # Precision
//!
//! No pass is bit-preserving, and none is meant to be — the knob's contract is that
//! [`None`](PipelineOptimization::None) is, and that each level stays inside a stated budget:
//!
//! - **[`Collapse`]** is exact up to `f64` re-association: folding `B·(A·x + a) + b` into
//!   `(B·A)·x + (B·a + b)` rounds differently in the last places, and eliding an identity
//!   affine drops multiplications by `0.0` that today turn a non-finite sample into `NaN`
//!   across every output channel. Measured against unoptimized output over the conformance
//!   battery the worst deviation is **1.0e-15 device units** — three ulps of a sample, and
//!   below what the gate's ΔE₀₀ lens can even resolve (STATUS.md).
//! - **[`Precalculate`]** is the lossy tier, and deliberately the *same* construction lcms2's
//!   default path applies: a 4096-point joined curve table and a grid-33 (RGB) / grid-17
//!   (CMYK) / grid-7 (hifi) resampled CLUT. Its budget is therefore the conformance gate's
//!   **LOOSE** row — max ΔE₀₀ `< 6e-1` for shaper pairs and `< 2.0` for LUT pairs (measured
//!   2.6e-1 / 5.1e-2) — because that row already measures exactly this approximation on the
//!   oracle's side (STATUS.md, "Conformance gate (P7)"). Matching lcms2's construction rather
//!   than inventing one also brings the *outputs* together: optimized-vs-lcms2-optimized
//!   measures 3.5e-3 ΔE₀₀ where unoptimized-vs-lcms2-optimized measures 3.3e-1.
//!
//! One deliberate divergence from lcms2: no white-point "scum dot" fixup is applied to the
//! resampled table (lcms2's `PatchLUT`, which its callers disable with
//! `cmsFLAGS_NOWHITEONWHITEFIXUP` — the conformance gate disables it too, because it would
//! dominate the metric at the device-white corner).
//!
//! [`Collapse`]: PipelineOptimization::Collapse
//! [`Precalculate`]: PipelineOptimization::Precalculate
