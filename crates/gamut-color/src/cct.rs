//! Correlated colour temperature (CCT) of a CIE 1931 chromaticity, by Robertson's method.
//!
//! Robertson's method walks a table of *isotemperature lines* — points on the Planckian locus in
//! the CIE 1960 UCS `(u, v)` plane, each with the slope of the line of constant CCT crossing it —
//! finds the pair of lines the sample falls between, and interpolates in **reciprocal** temperature
//! (mired), which is where the locus is close to linear. The table is Wyszecki & Stiles,
//! *Color Science*, 2nd edition, p. 228; `references/color/README.md` records its provenance.
//!
//! This is the definition raw-image formats build on: DNG 1.7.1 interpolates a camera's colour
//! calibrations by "linear interpolation using inverse correlated color temperature", so a white
//! balance given as a chromaticity has to become a temperature before the calibrations can be
//! weighted. [`gamut_dng`](https://docs.rs/gamut-dng) uses this for exactly that.
//!
//! Like the rest of this crate's `f64` colour science, the result is Tier-1 (correctness only) and
//! not bit-reproducible across platforms.
