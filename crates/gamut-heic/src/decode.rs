//! The pluggable HEVC-intra decode pipeline (issue #238, slice S3): the [`HevcDecoder`] hook, the
//! decoder's [`DecodedFrame`] output contract, and the derivation/colour/transform pipeline that
//! turns a HEIF item into planar samples or a presentation-ready [`ImageBuf<Rgba8>`].
//!
//! # Where the codec boundary sits
//!
//! `gamut-heic` owns the *container* and everything around the coded picture — item derivation
//! (`grid`/`iden`/`iovl`), colour conversion, chroma upsampling, alpha merge, and the
//! `clap`/`irot`/`imir` transforms — but not the HEVC codestream itself (its RBSP/slice/CTU decode
//! is codec scope, issue #18, and on many platforms is better served by a hardware/OS decoder).
//! [`HevcDecoder`] is that seam: a caller implements HEVC-intra decode once, and every compliant
//! HEIF image — single items, grids, overlays, identity derivations, alpha, and the transformative
//! properties — decodes through this crate.
//!
//! # FFI-adaptable by construction
//!
//! [`HevcDecoder`] is deliberately object-safe and C-shaped so a `-sys` shim can wrap a platform
//! decoder behind a function-pointer table (the actual `gamut-ffi` wiring is a later crate concern):
//!
//! - **Plain byte-slice input.** [`decode_intra`](HevcDecoder::decode_intra) receives the raw,
//!   length-prefixed item payload as `&[u8]`; an implementation bridges it to its decoder with the
//!   existing [`HevcConfig::annex_b`] / [`crate::iter_nal_units`] helpers. The *pipeline* (not the
//!   implementation) calls [`HevcConfig::validate_still_payload`] first, so a non-still payload never
//!   reaches the hook.
//! - **POD-ish output.** [`DecodedFrame`] is uniform `u16` sample planes plus a handful of scalars
//!   ([`ChromaFormat`] is `#[repr(u8)]`), which map onto a C struct without a translation layer.
//! - **`&mut self`.** A stateful platform decoder (reused contexts, GPU handles) fits behind
//!   `&mut self`; a pure function fits too.
//!
//! # Three presentation surfaces
//!
//! - [`HeifImage::decode_item_planar`] — the **raw** surface. It resolves an item through its
//!   derivation (coded → decoder; `iden` → source; `grid` → tile assembly in the plane domain) and
//!   returns the decoder's [`DecodedFrame`] untouched by colour or transforms. Everything a caller
//!   could want is here, at full bit depth and native chroma; the caller drives colour/transforms
//!   with the [`HeifItem`](crate::HeifItem) property accessors. `iovl` compositing is *not* on this
//!   surface (it is defined over RGBA) — it returns [`Error::Unsupported`], directing callers to the
//!   RGBA path.
//! - [`HeifImage::decode_item_rgba8`] / [`HeifImage::decode_primary_rgba8`] — the **presentation**
//!   surface. It planar-decodes (or `iovl`-composites), converts colour, merges the alpha auxiliary,
//!   and applies the item's transformative properties in `ipma` order. It presents **8-bit coded
//!   frames only**: a deeper frame is [`Error::Unsupported`] here rather than silently narrowed.
//! - [`HeifImage::decode_item_rgba16`] / [`HeifImage::decode_primary_rgba16`] — the **high-bit-depth
//!   presentation** surface (issue #303). The same pipeline over 16-bit samples: it accepts every
//!   coded depth [`DecodedFrame`] admits (`8..=16`) and normalizes samples to the full 16-bit range,
//!   so the buffer does not carry the coded depth — read that from the planar surface or `pixi`.
//!
//! Both presentation surfaces share one colour policy, documented on
//! [`HeifImage::decode_item_rgba8`]; anything outside it is [`Error::Unsupported`] on *those*
//! surfaces while the planar surface still delivers the samples.
