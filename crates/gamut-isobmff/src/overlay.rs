//! The `iovl` derived-image payload (ISO/IEC 23008-12 §6.6.2.4.2 `ImageOverlay`).
//!
//! An `iovl` item composes several coded images onto a single canvas: its
//! [`references`](crate::Item::references) carry a `dimg` entry listing the composed items in
//! placement order, and its [`payload`](crate::Item::payload) is an `ImageOverlay` struct giving
//! the canvas size, its background fill colour, and each input's top-left offset on the canvas. The
//! container models the reference and the payload bytes structurally; this helper is the opt-in
//! parser/serialiser for the payload, so a consumer that needs the overlay geometry does not have
//! to hand-decode the bytes. The composed image payloads themselves stay opaque to this crate.
//!
//! The wire layout (§6.6.2.4.2) is:
//!
//! ```text
//! version           u8    (= 0)
//! flags             u8    (bit 0 selects the field length: 0 → 16-bit, 1 → 32-bit)
//! canvas_fill_value u16 × 4   (R, G, B, A — the background the canvas is cleared to)
//! FieldLength = ((flags & 1) + 1) * 16   → 16- or 32-bit
//! output_width      u(FieldLength)          (canvas width,  unsigned)
//! output_height     u(FieldLength)          (canvas height, unsigned)
//! for i in 0..reference_count {             (one per `dimg` reference, in order)
//!     horizontal_offset s(FieldLength)      (top-left x on the canvas, SIGNED)
//!     vertical_offset   s(FieldLength)      (top-left y on the canvas, SIGNED)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `reference_count` is *not* stored in the payload — it is implied by the number of `dimg`
//! references — so [`ImageOverlay::parse`] takes it as a parameter and rejects a payload that does
//! not contain exactly that many offset pairs (truncated or with trailing bytes).
