//! The preserving rewrite: read a DNG losslessly, edit it surgically, write it back with
//! **nothing dropped** (issue #263).
//!
//! The typed codec ([`crate::DngEncoder`] / [`crate::DngDecoder`]) is deliberately lossy: it
//! models the DNG spec's structures and rebuilds files from that model, so unmodeled and vendor
//! material does not survive a decode → encode cycle. [`DngRewrite`] is the preservation path:
//! it parses the **whole** IFD tree on the lossless `gamut-ifd` model (unknown/vendor tags,
//! unknown field types — everything survives as data), exposes the tree for surgical edits, and
//! re-serialises it carrying every pixel payload **byte-for-byte** (strips/tiles are copied,
//! never re-encoded) and every tag value byte-exactly.
//!
//! The `MakerNote` blob gets special care: vendor notes commonly encode internal offsets
//! relative to the enclosing TIFF header, so relocating the blob makes them stale. The rewrite
//! **pins** the note at its original absolute offset whenever the new layout permits
//! ([`MakerNotePreservation`] reports the outcome).
