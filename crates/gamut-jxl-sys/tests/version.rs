//! types and `extern "C"` signatures in this crate were transcribed from. If `jpegxl-src` is ever
//! bumped, this fails until the declarations are re-checked against the new headers. It also
//! exercises the encoder/decoder create+destroy paths and forces link-time resolution of every
//! declared symbol, so the `links = "jxl"` link lines are proven to resolve in CI.
