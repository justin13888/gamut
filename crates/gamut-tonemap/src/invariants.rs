//! Executable laws for the [`ToneCurve`] contract, shared by the property tests and the fuzz tier.
//!
//! Each function takes plain data, checks one law, and returns a [`Violation`] naming what broke
//! it. No test framework is involved and nothing here panics, so the same body runs under a
//! pinned-seed `proptest` in the per-PR gate and under a corpus-guided driver in extended CI
//! (issues #264, #311). A property is the specification a fuzzer checks, and writing it once is
//! what keeps the two lanes from drifting apart.
//!
//! The laws here are the trait's own documented contract, made executable. [`ToneCurve`] states
//! it in prose — "for a finite, non-negative input, every built-in operator returns a
//! non-negative output and **never NaN** … every built-in is monotonic non-decreasing in `x` up
//! to f32 rounding" — and until now nothing quantified over the input domain to check it. The
//! per-operator tests in `operators.rs` pin fixed points and reference values, which is a
//! different and complementary claim: they say *where the curve goes*, these say *what shape it
//! has everywhere*.
//!
//! Inputs are normalised into a bounded, finite, non-negative range by [`normalise_input`], so an
//! arbitrary byte string from a fuzz driver maps to a cheap case. Normalising is the **caller's**
//! job, deliberately: a law that normalised its own inputs would feed the same value to the model
//! and to the code under test, and a defect in the normaliser would cancel on both sides.
//!
//! This module is the test oracle, not the system under test, so `.cargo/mutants.toml` excludes
//! `crates/*/src/invariants.rs` from mutation.
