//! The AV1 **still-encode** backend seam: the typed [`Av1StillEncoder`] trait a caller plugs an
//! alternate AV1 encoder into, the [`Av1EncodeRequest`] describing one encode job, and the
//! [`AbiAv1StillEncoder`] adapter that bridges a [`gamut_codec_abi::Encoder`] (and, through
//! [`gamut_codec_abi::bridge::ForeignEncoder`], a C/`-sys` backend) onto it.
//!
//! This is the write-direction mirror of the [`Av1StillDecoder`](crate::Av1StillDecoder) seam:
//! `gamut-avif` owns the container and everything around the coded picture, while the AV1
//! codestream itself may come from a platform or reference encoder (libaom, SVT-AV1, a hardware
//! encoder, …). The shape and the fallback contract are the workspace-wide ones defined by
//! [`gamut_codec_abi`] (issue #241/#272):
//!
//! - Backends are tried in **push order** ([`AvifEncoder::push_backend`](crate::AvifEncoder::push_backend)).
//! - [`Av1StillEncoder::supports`] returning `false` — or, across the C seam,
//!   [`Status::UNSUPPORTED`](gamut_codec_abi::Status::UNSUPPORTED) — is the **only** fall-through
//!   signal.
//! - `gamut-av1`'s [`encode_still_intra_with`](gamut_av1::encode_still_intra_with) is the
//!   **implicit tail**,
//!   used when every pushed backend declines. `gamut-av1` itself is unaware of this seam.
//! - A backend that *accepts* a job and then fails propagates its error; the tail is **not** retried,
//!   because silently substituting a different encoder would make the output non-deterministic.
//!
//! # The `av1C` record for a backend-supplied stream
//!
//! The container's `av1C`/`colr` boxes must mirror the sequence header the item payload actually
//! carries (AV1-ISOBMFF v1.3.0 §2.3.4). For the built-in tail those values come back from
//! `gamut-av1`; for a backend they are recovered from the returned OBUs themselves —
//! `seq_profile`, `seq_level_idx[0]`, the coded dimensions and `color_config()` are read from the
//! sequence header, the colour configuration is checked against the one the request asked for (so
//! the `colr` box can never disagree with the payload), and the stream is then checked against the
//! AVIF still-image item constraints
//! ([`Av1Config::validate_still_payload`](crate::Av1Config::validate_still_payload)). The rest of
//! the pixel parameters (8-bit, 4:4:4) are the v1 surface's fixed contract, stated on
//! [`Av1StillEncoder::encode_still`] and enforced by the `seq_profile` check.

/// `base_q_idx` would invent a second, contradictory mapping. The adapter therefore leaves
/// `quality` at `0` and passes the authoritative quantizer out-of-band, as the codec-specific
/// [`EncodeConfig::extra`] blob: **one byte**, the AV1 `base_q_idx`. A backend registered for
/// [`AV1_CODEC_ID`] must read `extra`, and must not read `quality`.

/// `-sys` encoder owns the job at every depth rather than silently losing the high-bit-depth ones to
/// the software tail.
///
/// [`ImageDesc`] describes the two identically except in three places, and a backend reading the
/// descriptor must honour all three:
///
/// - [`ImageDesc::depth`] is the **coded** depth — `8`, `10` or `12` — never the storage width.
/// - [`ImageDesc::strides`] are in **bytes**, so a high-bit-depth row is twice its sample count.
/// - Above 8 bits the plane pointers address native-endian `u16` samples, **right-justified** at
///   the coded depth (a 10-bit sample occupies `0..=1023`, not the top ten bits of a `u16`).
///   [`ImageDesc::pixel_format`] carries `Rgb16` rather than `Rgb8` to say so, and `Planar16`
///   validates every sample against its depth, so the range is a guarantee and not a convention.
///
/// # Status handling
///
/// [`Status::UNSUPPORTED`] is the fall-through code in both places it can appear: from `supports`
/// (as `false`) and — for a backend that changes its mind — from `encode`, where it is treated as
